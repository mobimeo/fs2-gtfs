/**
  * Transit agencies with service.
  *
  * Conditionally Required:
  * - Required when the dataset contains data for multiple transit agencies.
  * - Recommended otherwise.
  *
  * @param id Identifies a transit brand which is often synonymous with a transit agency.
  *          Note that in some cases, such as when a single agency operates multiple separate services,
  *          agencies and brands are distinct.
  *          This document uses the term "agency" in place of "brand".
  *          A dataset may contain data from multiple agencies.
  * @param name Full name of the transit agency
  * @param url URL of the transit agency
  * @param timezone Timezone where the transit agency is located.
  *          If multiple agencies are specified in the dataset, each must have the same agency_timezone.
  * @param language Primary language used by this transit agency.
  *          Should be provided to help GTFS consumers choose capitalization rules and other language-specific settings for the dataset.
  * @param phone A voice telephone number for the specified agency.
  *          This field is a string value that presents the telephone number as typical for the agency's service area.
  *          It may contain punctuation marks to group the digits of the number.
  *          Dialable text (for example, TriMet's "503-238-RIDE") is permitted, but the field must not contain any other descriptive text.
  * @param fareUrl URL of a web page that allows a rider to purchase tickets or other fare instruments for that agency online.
  * @param email Email address actively monitored by the agencyâ€™s customer service department.
  *          This email address should be a direct contact point where transit riders can reach a customer service representative at the agency.
  * @param ticketingDeepLinkId
